I was facing a libssl1.1 issue when trying to install mongo-db in Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS (or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).

As @stephen-kitt mentioned libssl1.x is an obsolete package. So you need to manually install the required package.

Go to this page
Find the exact version of libssl for example libssl1.1.1
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.20_amd64.deb (use your version url respectively)
Then install with sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.20_amd64.deb
Hope this helps others who are trying to do the same.

The issue is referenced on Github, all credit goes to @feisalramar.
